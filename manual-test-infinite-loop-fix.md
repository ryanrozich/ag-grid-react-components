# Manual Test for Infinite Loop Fix - Page Load

## Steps to Test:

1. Make sure the dev server is running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser's Developer Console (F12)

3. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/

4. Watch the console immediately as the page loads

## Expected Result:

- You should see a few "Grid state saved to URL" messages (1-5 is normal)
- The messages should stop after initial load
- NO continuous stream of messages

## What was Fixed:

The issue was that multiple `filterChanged` event listeners were being registered:

1. One from `setupGridStatePersistence`
2. Another manually added in `onGridReady`

When state was loaded from URL, it would trigger filter changes, which would trigger saves, creating a potential loop.

The fix:

1. Added an `isLoadingState` flag to prevent the manual filterChanged listener from firing during URL state loading
2. Properly clean up all event listeners on unmount
3. Added a small delay after loading state to ensure all events settle

## If You Still See the Loop:

1. Check the console for any error messages
2. Try clearing your browser's local storage and cookies
3. Try loading the page with a clean URL (no parameters): http://localhost:5173/
4. Check if any browser extensions might be interfering

## Additional Test:

After the page loads successfully:

1. Apply a filter using the Quick Filter Dropdown
2. You should see only 1-2 "Grid state saved to URL" messages
3. The URL should update with the compressed grid state
4. Refreshing the page should restore the filter without causing a loop
