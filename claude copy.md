# Development Preferences

## Technical Stack
- TypeScript for all code
- React functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite as the build tool
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
- date-fns for date manipulation

## Development Approach
- Use test-driven development (TDD) - write tests first, then implement features
- Validate that tests pass at each step before moving to the next feature
- Create a local git repository and commit changes frequently
- Use atomic, focused commits with descriptive messages

## Code Style
- Strong TypeScript typing with interfaces for all props and models
- Clean component organization with proper separation of concerns
- Self-documenting code with comments for complex logic
- Responsive design using Tailwind utility classes

## Project Structure
- `/src/components` for React components
- `/src/utils` for utility functions
- `/src/types` for TypeScript interfaces
- `/src/tests` for test helpers (if needed separately)
- Component files accompanied by test files in the same directory
