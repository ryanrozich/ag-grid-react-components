## üéØ Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Priority**

   ```bash
   # Fix the failing tests
   npm run test:unit -- filterStateUtils.test.ts

   # Fix E2E tests
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

2. **Before Commit**

   ```bash
   # Run quality checks
   npm run pre-commit

   # Generate coverage report
   npm run test:coverage
   npm run coverage:report
   ```

3. **Clean up files**

   ```bash
   # Remove debug/temp files
   rm filter-test.html test-filter-direct.html test-manual-filter.html test-quick-filter.html
   rm debug-filter-models.js
   rm src/foo.test.ts
   rm src/immediate-issues-summary.md
   rm -rf playwright-report test-results

   # Archive planning docs
   mkdir -p docs/archive
   mv refactoring-todo*.md quick-filter-dropdown-*.md docs/archive/
   ```

4. **Final Release Prep**
   ```bash
   # Create first release
   npm run release:first
   ```

## üìä Test Summary

- **Total Test Files**: 15 unit test files + 2 E2E test files
- **Test Status**: All filterStateUtils tests passing, some other tests still have issues
- **Coverage**: Generated - filterStateUtils.ts has 60.26% coverage
- **Test Frameworks**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

- **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple TypeScript errors need fixing (unused imports, type mismatches)
