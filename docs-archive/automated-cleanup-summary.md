# Automated PR Preview Cleanup Summary

## What Happens Automatically When a PR is Merged

With your GitHub secrets now configured, the following will happen automatically when any PR is merged:

### 1. **Cleanup PR Preview Workflow** (`cleanup-pr-preview.yml`)

Triggered when a PR is closed AND merged:

- ✅ **Deletes Cloudflare Worker** (`ag-grid-demo-api-pr-*`) using the API
- ✅ **Deletes KV metadata entry** using wrangler
- ✅ **Deletes R2 bucket objects** using AWS CLI with your new R2 credentials
- ✅ **Posts a cleanup confirmation comment** on the PR

### 2. **Update Preview URL Field Workflow** (`update-preview-url-field.yml`)

Triggered when a PR is closed (merged or not):

- ✅ **Clears the Preview URL field** in the GitHub project
- ✅ **Removes the `has-preview` label** from the PR

## Required GitHub Secrets

You've already added these to your repository:

1. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - For worker and KV deletion
2. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - For API calls
3. `CLOUDFLARE_KV_NAMESPACE_ID` - For KV deletion
4. `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - For R2 deletion (NEW)
5. `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - For R2 deletion (NEW)

## Testing the Automation

The next time you merge a PR with a preview deployment:

1. Check the "Actions" tab to see the cleanup workflow run
2. Look for the cleanup comment on the PR
3. Verify in Cloudflare Dashboard that all resources are gone:
   - Workers & Pages → No `ag-grid-demo-api-pr-*` workers
   - Workers & Pages → KV → No PR entries
   - R2 → rozich-demos bucket → No PR folders

## No Further Changes Needed

**You don't need to create any new commits or PRs!** The workflows are already updated and will use your newly added secrets automatically.

## What Was Changed

During our session, we updated:

1. **Worker deletion**: Changed from non-existent `wrangler delete` to Cloudflare API
2. **R2 cleanup**: Added AWS CLI commands to delete R2 objects
3. **Environment checks**: Added checks for R2 credentials

These changes are already in your main branch and will apply to all future PR merges.
