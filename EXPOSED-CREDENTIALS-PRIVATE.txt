PRIVATE - DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE
==================================

These credentials were exposed in git history and need to be rotated:

CRITICAL - MUST ROTATE:
- Cloudflare API Token: DjTyXzQpd8fIhaGiJ_X4TnnufvHQOTQ9qxro2QDN
- Cloudflare R2 Secret Access Key: 9a4fd96db810e48e587e67b703579d888e5c0af8a6e67a62a4775a35373dbd16

LESS CRITICAL - But should still rotate:
- Cloudflare R2 Access Key ID: 8da626e7ba222183e63b5b089035511b

NOT SECRET - These are identifiers, not authentication credentials:
- Cloudflare Account ID: 7f690032c0ff5823383aa34dde19588a (This is like a username, not a password)
- Cloudflare KV Namespace ID: b0cc56f8dbf54ebd86d4d43567e1ad99 (This identifies which KV namespace to use)

ROTATION PRIORITY:
1. API Token - This has full access to your Cloudflare account
2. R2 Secret Access Key - This allows access to R2 storage
3. R2 Access Key ID - Less critical but pairs with the secret key

The Account ID and Namespace ID are not secrets - they're identifiers that are often
included in public code. However, without the API token, they can't be used maliciously.
