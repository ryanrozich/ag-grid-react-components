# Bug Fixes Ported from RC2

This report documents which bug fixes from release/v0.2.0-rc2 were analyzed and ported to release/v0.2.0-rc3.

## Ported Fixes

### 1. Grand Total Row Z-Index Issue (#6)

**Issue**: Grand total row value overlapping with date filter dropdown
**Status**: ✅ PORTED
**Implementation**: Created `src/demo/styles/ag-grid-fixes.css` with z-index fixes for AG Grid filter popups, menus, and wrapper elements
**Commit**: a8d1818

## Fixes Not Needed (Already Addressed by Headless Refactor)

### 2. DateFilter State Reset Issue (#69)

**Issue**: DateFilter state being reset when typing in filter inputs
**Status**: ❌ NOT PORTED (Not Applicable)
**Reason**: The headless DateFilter implementation uses a completely different architecture with context providers and controlled components. The original issue was specific to the old implementation's state management pattern.

### 3. Various Infinite Loop Fixes

**Status**: ❌ NOT PORTED (Not Applicable)
**Affected Components in RC2**:

- QuickFilterDropdown
- usePresetFromUrl hook
- ServerStats component
- AvatarCellRenderer

**Reason**: These components were either completely rewritten in the headless refactor or don't exist in the current implementation. The headless architecture inherently avoids the state management patterns that caused these infinite loops.

## Summary

- **Total RC2 Bug Fixes Analyzed**: 3 categories
- **Fixes Ported**: 1 (Grand total row z-index)
- **Fixes Not Needed**: 2 categories (DateFilter state reset, infinite loops)

The headless refactor's improved architecture eliminated the need for most RC2 bug fixes. The only fix that remained relevant was the CSS z-index issue for grand total rows, which is a styling concern independent of the component architecture.
