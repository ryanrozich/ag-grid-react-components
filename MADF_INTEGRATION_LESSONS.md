# MADF Integration Lessons Learned

This document captures lessons learned while integrating 6 parallel PRs for the filter presets milestone.

## Context

- 6 issues (#47-52) worked on in parallel by AI agents
- Each created a PR with isolated features
- Now need to integrate them for release

## Lessons Learned

### 1. File Conflicts

**Observation**: Multiple PRs modify the same files:

- `src/index.ts` - All PRs add exports
- `src/demo/components-showcase-complete.tsx` - Multiple demos added
- `README.md` - Multiple documentation sections

**MADF Consideration**:

- Agents should be aware of "high-conflict files"
- Consider a locking mechanism or assigned sections
- Maybe a "merge coordinator" agent role?

### 2. API Consistency

**Observation**: PR #53 establishes core interfaces (FilterPreset, StorageAdapter) that other PRs will need to use. This is good foundation work.

**MADF Consideration**:

- Need shared contracts/interfaces defined upfront
- Central type definitions that all agents reference
- Foundation PRs should be clearly marked and prioritized

### 3. Dependency Management

**Observation**: [To be filled during review]

**MADF Consideration**:

- Agents need to understand dependency order
- Some way to communicate "I depend on issue X"

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Observation**: [To be filled during review]

**MADF Consideration**:

- Integration tests vs unit tests
- Who writes the integration tests?

## Integration Log

### PR #53: Core Storage Engine (Merged First)

1. **Review**: Clean implementation with good test coverage (54 tests, 100% coverage)
2. **Integration Issue**: Exports were not added to main index.ts
3. **Fix Applied**: Added PresetStorageEngine exports to src/index.ts
4. **Lesson**: Agents should have a checklist item to update main exports
5. **Major Issue**: Trunk formatter ran on commit and modified 53 files, creating massive conflicts for subsequent merges
6. **Lesson**: Agents should be instructed to disable auto-formatting on commits during integration phase

**New MADF Considerations**:

- Integration checklist for each agent (update exports, update README, etc.)
- Maybe a "integration-ready" label that agents add when they've done all steps
- **Critical**: Formatting must be coordinated - either all agents format consistently or formatting is disabled during parallel work
- Integration agent needs different git hooks/config than development agents

### PR #58: UI Components (Merged Second)

1. **Blocking Issue**: 144 file conflicts from Trunk formatting in previous commit
2. **Root Cause**: Auto-formatting on commit created changes across entire codebase
3. **Fix Strategy**: Reset non-essential files and retry merge
4. **Integration Result**: Successfully merged after cleanup
5. **Test Status**: 1 test failure - keyboard interaction test expecting Enter not to submit in textarea
6. **Lesson**: Test expectations need to be aligned across parallel development teams

**New MADF Considerations**:

- Need a pre-integration formatting check/synchronization step
- Consider running integration tests in a clean branch without formatting hooks
- Test suites should be run before PR creation to catch these issues

### PR #55: Sharing System (Merged Third)

1. **Integration Result**: Clean merge with only bot file conflicts
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Bot files (.bot/context.json, .bot/memory.md) easily resolved by accepting incoming changes
3. **Test Status**: All 102 tests passing - excellent isolated development
4. **Lesson**: Bot-specific files should be excluded from integration branches

**New MADF Considerations**:

- Bot work files should be in .gitignore or cleaned before PR creation
- Each agent workspace can have isolated bot state
- Integration branch should not include agent-specific metadata
