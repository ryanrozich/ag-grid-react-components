# Examples Summary

## What We Built

We created comprehensive example configurations based on ag-grid-react-components' successful patterns:

1. **Full Configuration Examples** (`examples/`)

   - Complete MADF config with all options
   - Testing setups (Vitest, Playwright)
   - Linting setups (Trunk, ESLint, Prettier)
   - GitHub templates (issues, PRs, labels)
   - Component structure templates

2. **Copy Scripts**
   - `copy-examples.sh` - Simple copying
   - `interactive-setup.sh` - Wizard-style setup

## The Pivot

After discussion, we realized MADF should be simpler:

### Instead of This (Full Configs)

```
MADF ships → vitest.config.ts, eslintrc.js, etc.
Projects → Copy and modify files
```

### Do This (Tool Sets)

```
MADF ships → Tool set definitions
Projects → Choose tools, MADF generates commands
```

## What Happens to These Examples?

1. **Keep them here** - They're valuable reference implementations
2. **Use them to inform** - Help define MADF's tool sets
3. **Maybe later** - Could become a separate "MADF templates" repo
4. **Learn from them** - See what patterns work across projects

## Key Insight

Projects want to:

- Choose their tools quickly ("I want the React library setup")
- Override specific things ("But with 95% coverage")
- Not copy tons of config files

So MADF should provide **tool combinations**, not **configuration files**.

## For MADF

See:

- `MADF_TOOLSETS_EXPORT.md` - The tool set concept
- `MADF_INTEGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - How to implement

The examples here show what a "full implementation" looks like, which helps understand what the tool sets should enable.
