# Continuing Bot Work on Issue #47

The issue has been claimed and the worktree is set up! Here's how to continue:

## Current Status

- ✅ Issue #47 claimed
- ✅ Labels updated (agent:wip)
- ✅ Worktree created at: `~/ag-grid-worktrees/feature/47-implement-core-storage-engine-for-filter-presets`
- ✅ Dependencies installed

## To Continue Working

In your Claude Code instance, navigate to the worktree:

```bash
cd ~/ag-grid-worktrees/feature/47-implement-core-storage-engine-for-filter-presets
```

Then start implementing based on issue #47 requirements:

1. **Create the storage engine structure:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/utils/presetStorage
   mkdir -p src/utils/presetStorage/__tests__
   ```

2. **Start implementing the files listed in the issue:**

   - `src/utils/presetStorage/PresetStorageEngine.ts`
   - `src/utils/presetStorage/types.ts`
   - `src/utils/presetStorage/migrations.ts`
   - Tests for everything

3. **Save checkpoints as you work:**

   ```bash
   node ~/code-repos/github/ryanrozich/ag-grid-react-components/scripts/bot-workflow/core/bot-checkpoint.js "Implemented basic storage engine"
   ```

4. **When ready, create the PR:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: implement core storage engine for filter presets"
   git push -u origin feature/47-implement-core-storage-engine-for-filter-presets
   gh pr create --fill
   ```
