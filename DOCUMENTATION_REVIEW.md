# Documentation Review for v0.1.0 First Release

## Issues Found

### 1. Legacy/Migration References (Confusing for First Release)

Since this is v0.1.0 - the **first public release** - there are no previous versions to migrate from. However, the documentation contains several confusing references:

#### README.md (Line 336)

- Contains section "Migration from Legacy Version"
- Shows migration from `setupFilterStatePersistence` to `setupGridStatePersistence`
- This is internal refactoring, not a public API migration

#### CLAUDE.md (Line 902)

- States: "The original `setupFilterStatePersistence` is still available for backward compatibility"
- References "migrating to `setupGridStatePersistence`"

#### src/index.ts

- Line 5: "Export RelativeDateFilter as alias for backward compatibility"
- Line 22: "Legacy type exports for backward compatibility"
- Line 70: "Default export remains the DateFilter for backward compatibility"

### 2. Incorrect API Documentation

#### public/llms.txt

Shows a completely different API pattern:

```typescript
import { createDateFilter } from "ag-grid-react-components";
const DateFilter = createDateFilter();
```

But the actual API is:

```typescript
import { DateFilter } from "ag-grid-react-components";
```

### 3. Architecture Claims

The package is described as "modular" and "tree-shakeable" which is accurate from a technical perspective (webpack/rollup can tree-shake unused exports), but it's actually a **single npm package** not multiple packages.

## Recommendations

### 1. Remove All Legacy/Migration References

- This is v0.1.0 - there's nothing to migrate from
- Keep the functionality but remove confusing terminology
- Instead of "migration", frame it as "Advanced Options" or "Full State Persistence"

### 2. Clarify Architecture

- It's a single package with tree-shakeable exports
- Components are modular in design but packaged together
- This is actually better for users (one install, one version)

### 3. Fix API Documentation

- Update llms.txt to show the actual API
- Ensure all examples use the correct import patterns

### 4. Reframe State Persistence Options

Instead of "migration", present it as:

- Basic: Filter persistence only (`setupFilterStatePersistence`)
- Advanced: Full grid state persistence (`setupGridStatePersistence`)

## Benefits of Current Architecture

1. **Simple for users**: One package to install
2. **Tree-shakeable**: Only includes what you use
3. **No version conflicts**: Single package = single version
4. **Great bundle sizes**: 25KB minimal, 85KB full featured

## Action Items

1. ✅ Remove "Migration from Legacy Version" section from README.md
2. ✅ Remove backward compatibility references from CLAUDE.md
3. ✅ Update src/index.ts comments to remove legacy references
4. ✅ Update llms.txt to show correct API
5. ✅ Reframe filter persistence options without migration terminology
