# QuickFilterDropdown Z-Index Fix

## Issue

The QuickFilterDropdown options were appearing behind other UI elements (stats cards, grid) making them unusable.

## Root Cause

1. Original z-index of 1050 was too low compared to other elements
2. Parent containers had overflow:hidden which could clip dropdowns
3. No z-index boost when dropdown was in open state

## Solution Applied

1. Increased dropdown z-index from 1050 to 9999
2. Added z-index: 100 to container for proper stacking context
3. Added z-index: 9999 !important to the open dropdown state
4. Kept position: absolute (not fixed) to maintain proper positioning

## Changes Made

- `src/components/QuickFilterDropdown/QuickFilterDropdown.module.css`:
  - `.dropdown` z-index: 1050 â†’ 9999
  - `.container` added z-index: 100
  - `.container.open .dropdown` added z-index: 9999 !important

## Testing Notes

- Verify dropdowns appear above stats cards
- Verify dropdowns appear above grid
- Test in both light and dark themes
- Test with different viewport sizes
