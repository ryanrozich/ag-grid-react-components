# DateFilter Test Coverage Improvements

## Summary
Successfully increased DateFilter test coverage from 54.58% to 82.27% (exceeding the 80% target).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Inclusivity Flag Handling
- Added `fromInclusive` and `toInclusive` to the `useFilterState` hook
- Updated the filter state to properly store and manage inclusivity flags
- Fixed the `currentModel` to use the stored inclusivity flags from filter state

### 2. Added Support for Open-Ended Ranges
- Modified the validation logic to allow inRange filters with only start or end date
- Updated the `doesFilterPass` logic to handle open-ended ranges properly
- Changed validation to use OR logic instead of AND for range dates

### 3. Fixed Integration Tests
All 25 DateFilter integration tests now pass, including:
- Inclusive/exclusive date filtering
- Open-ended range support
- Time normalization
- Relative date expressions

### 4. Updated Validation Tests
Updated the validation tests to match the new open-ended range behavior.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `src/components/DateFilter/hooks/useFilterState.ts` - Added inclusivity flags
2. `src/components/DateFilter/index.tsx` - Fixed inclusivity handling and open-ended ranges
3. `src/components/DateFilter/hooks/useFilterValidation.ts` - Updated validation for open-ended ranges
4. `src/components/DateFilter/hooks/useFilterValidation.test.ts` - Updated tests for new behavior

### Coverage Results:
- DateFilter: 82.27% (up from 54.58%)
- DateFilter/components: 97.22%
- ActiveFilters: 92.59%

### Key Patterns Used:
- Type guards for TypeScript type narrowing
- Proper state management with React hooks
- Comprehensive integration testing with AG Grid mocks
- Support for both absolute and relative date filtering
