# AG Grid v33 setFilterModel Workaround Implementation

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive workaround for AG Grid v33 bug where `setFilterModel()` doesn't properly initialize custom React filter components.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/components/QuickFilterDropdown/utils/agGridWorkaround.ts**

   - Main workaround implementation
   - Handles Promise-based filter instances
   - Forces manual setModel call and grid refresh

2. **src/components/QuickFilterDropdown/utils/filterModelBuilder.ts**

   - Integrated workaround into quick filter application
   - Uses workaround for single-column filters

3. **src/components/DateFilter/index.tsx**
   - Added useEffect to handle model prop changes
   - Enhanced logging for debugging
   - Improved state synchronization

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { applyFilterModelWithWorkaround } from "./agGridWorkaround";

// Instead of:
api.setFilterModel({ columnId: filterModel });

// Use:
await applyFilterModelWithWorkaround(api, columnId, filterModel);
```

### Key Features

- Handles AG Grid v33's Promise-based filter instances
- Adds proper timing for React component lifecycle
- Forces grid refresh with refreshCells() and redrawRows()
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Testing

- Created comprehensive e2e tests
- Verified filter logic works (row count reduces correctly)
- Identified DOM rendering timing issues that may require additional handling

### Future Considerations

- Monitor AG Grid releases for official fix
- Remove workaround when bug is resolved
- May need adjustments for different AG Grid versions
