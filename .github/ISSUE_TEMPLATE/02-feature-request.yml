        Users struggle with date filtering in AG Grid. They want to use expressions like "last 30 days" 
        that update dynamically, but AG Grid only supports static date ranges...

      required: true

        Add a new RelativeDateFilter component that:
        1. Accepts expressions like "today-30d"
        2. Re-evaluates on each filter pass
        3. Integrates with URL persistence

        - Would need to modify: src/components/DateFilter/index.tsx
        - Add new hook: useRelativeDateExpression
        - Update filter model interface in src/types/index.ts
        - Requires date-fns for date calculations
