# Test Feature: Advanced Filter Presets

Let's implement a feature that can be broken down into multiple parallel tasks to demonstrate the framework's capabilities with your Claude Code max subscription.

## Feature Overview

Add a filter preset system that allows users to:

- Save current filter configurations as named presets
- Load saved presets with one click
- Share presets via URLs
- Import/export presets as JSON

## Parallel Task Breakdown

This feature is perfect for parallel development because it has:

1. **Independent components** that can be built simultaneously
2. **Clear interfaces** between components
3. **Separate test suites** for each part

### Task 1: Preset Storage Component

- Create FilterPresetStorage component
- Implement localStorage persistence
- Add CRUD operations for presets
- Unit tests

### Task 2: UI Components

- Create SavePresetDialog component
- Create PresetSelector dropdown
- Add preset management UI
- Component tests

### Task 3: URL Sharing System

- Implement preset serialization to URL
- Add URL parsing on load
- Create shareable links
- Integration tests

### Task 4: Import/Export Feature

- Add JSON export functionality
- Create import dialog with validation
- Handle error cases
- E2E tests

### Task 5: Demo & Documentation

- Update demo app with preset examples
- Add API documentation
- Create usage guide
- Update README

## Why This Tests the Framework Well

1. **Parallelization**: All 5 tasks can run simultaneously
2. **Bot-Friendly**: Each task has clear acceptance criteria
3. **CI/CD Testing**: Each PR will trigger preview deployments
4. **Real Value**: This is a useful feature for the library

## How to Execute with Max Subscription

With Claude Code max subscription, you can:

1. Open 5 separate Claude Code instances
2. Each instance claims one task
3. All work in parallel in different git worktrees
4. No conflicts or blocking between agents
