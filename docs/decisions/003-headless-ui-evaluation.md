# Headless UI Evaluation for AG Grid React Components

## Overview

This document evaluates whether [Headless UI](<[https://headlessui.com](https://headlessui.com)/>) would be beneficial for the AG Grid React Components library.

## What is Headless UI

Headless UI provides completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components designed to integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. It handles:

- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes
- Screen reader announcements

## Current Component Architecture

Our components currently:

- Use CSS Modules for styling isolation
- Implement accessibility features manually
- Handle keyboard navigation in-house
- Provide CSS variables for theming

## Pros of Adding Headless UI

### 1. Improved Accessibility

````tsx
// With Headless UI
import { Listbox } from "@headlessui/react";

<Listbox value={selected} onChange={setSelected}>
  <Listbox.Button>{selected.label}</Listbox.Button>
  <Listbox.Options>
    {options.map((option) => (
      <Listbox.Option key={option.id} value={option}>
        {option.label}
      </Listbox.Option>
    ))}
  </Listbox.Options>
</Listbox>;
// Automatically handles ARIA, keyboard nav, focus trap
```text

### 2. Reduced Maintenance

- No need to maintain keyboard navigation code
- Accessibility updates handled by Headless UI team
- Battle-tested implementations

### 3. Better Component Composition

```tsx
// More flexible component composition
<Transition show={isOpen} enter="transition-opacity duration-75" enterFrom="opacity-0" enterTo="opacity-100">
  <DateFilter />
</Transition>
````

## Cons of Adding Headless UI

### 1. Additional Dependency

- Adds ~25KB to bundle (before tree shaking)
- Another external dependency to track
- Potential breaking changes between versions

### 2. Integration Complexity with AG Grid

- AG Grid has specific requirements for filter components
- Need to bridge Headless UI patterns with AG Grid's API
- May complicate the `useGridFilter` integration

### 3. Limited Styling Flexibility

- Headless UI is designed for Tailwind CSS
- Our users may not use Tailwind
- Would need to provide both styled and unstyled versions

### 4. Migration Effort

- Significant refactoring required
- Need to maintain backward compatibility
- Risk of introducing bugs

## Component-Specific Analysis

### QuickFilterDropdown

#### Good fit for Headless UI

- Classic dropdown/select pattern
- Would benefit from Listbox component
- Better keyboard navigation out of the box

### DateFilter

#### Poor fit for Headless UI

- Complex custom component
- Tightly integrated with AG Grid
- Custom validation and state management

### ActiveFilters

#### Not needed

- Simple component with basic interactions
- No complex accessibility requirements
- Current implementation is sufficient

## Recommendation

**Do NOT add Headless UI** as a dependency, but consider a hybrid approach:

### 1. Study Headless UI Patterns

Learn from their accessibility implementations:

- Keyboard navigation patterns
- ARIA attribute usage
- Focus management techniques

### 2. Create Headless Variants (Future)

For v2.0, consider offering headless variants:

````tsx
// Headless version for maximum flexibility
import { DateFilterHeadless } from "ag-grid-react-components/headless";

// Regular version with built-in styles
import { DateFilter } from "ag-grid-react-components";
```text

### 3. Improve Current Accessibility

Apply Headless UI patterns without the dependency:

```tsx
// Implement proper ARIA patterns
<div role="listbox" aria-labelledby={labelId} aria-activedescendant={activeId}>
  {options.map((option) => (
    <div role="option" aria-selected={isSelected} tabIndex={isActive ? 0 : -1}>
      {option.label}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```text

## Alternative Approach: Accessibility Utils

Create internal utilities inspired by Headless UI:

```typescript
// utils/accessibility.ts
export function useListboxKeyboard({ options, onSelect, isOpen }) {
  // Implement keyboard navigation
  // Handle focus management
  // Manage ARIA attributes
}

export function useCombobox({ options, onSelect, onSearch }) {
  // Combobox-specific logic
}
````

## Migration Path (If Ever Needed)

If we decide to adopt Headless UI in the future:

1. **Phase 1**: Create headless variants alongside existing components
2. **Phase 2**: Mark styled versions as deprecated
3. **Phase 3**: Move styled versions to separate package
4. **Phase 4**: Make headless versions the default

## Conclusion

While Headless UI offers excellent accessibility features, adding it as a dependency would:

- Increase bundle size significantly
- Add complexity to AG Grid integration
- Force architectural decisions on users

Instead, we should:

1. Learn from Headless UI's patterns
2. Improve our accessibility implementation
3. Keep the library lightweight and focused
4. Consider headless variants in a future major version

The current approach of CSS Modules + CSS variables provides sufficient flexibility while maintaining a small footprint and AG Grid compatibility.
