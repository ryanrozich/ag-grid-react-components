## Remaining Work for Engineering Excellence

### 1. Test Coverage Gap (25% remaining)

```typescript
// Need comprehensive E2E tests
describe("DateFilter E2E", () => {
  it("should handle complete user workflow", async () => {
    // Full user journey testing
  });
});

// Need performance benchmarks
describe("Performance", () => {
  it("should filter 10k rows in <16ms", () => {
    // Performance regression tests
  });
});
```

### 2. Build System Optimization

```typescript
// Current: Single bundle
dist/ag-grid-date-filter.es.js  226.46 kB

// Target: Code-split bundles
dist/core.js         50KB
dist/date-picker.js  30KB  // Lazy loaded
dist/expressions.js  20KB  // Lazy loaded
```

### 3. Advanced Features
