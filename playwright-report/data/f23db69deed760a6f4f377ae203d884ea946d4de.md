   4 |  * This test documents a bug where the "to" field in relative date range filters
   5 |  * disappears after selecting or typing a value.
   6 |  *
   7 |  * Steps to reproduce:
   8 |  * 1. Open date filter
   9 |  * 2. Switch to "Relative" mode
   10 |  * 3. Select "In Range" filter type
   11 |  * 4. Type or select a value in the "to" field
   12 |  * 5. The value disappears immediately
   13 |  *
   14 |  * GitHub Issue: TBD
