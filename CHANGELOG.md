## [Unreleased]

### üí• BREAKING CHANGES

- **Removed RelativeDateFloatingFilter component**: AG Grid now provides an automatic read-only floating filter when `floatingFilter: true` is set. The RelativeDateFilter's `getModelAsString()` method provides the display text.

  **Migration Guide:**

  ```typescript
  // Before:
  import {
    RelativeDateFilter,
    RelativeDateFloatingFilter,
  } from "ag-grid-react-components";

  columnDefs = [
    {
      filter: RelativeDateFilter,
      floatingFilter: true,
      floatingFilterComponent: RelativeDateFloatingFilter,
    },
  ];

  // After:
  import { RelativeDateFilter } from "ag-grid-react-components";

  columnDefs = [
    {
      filter: RelativeDateFilter,
      floatingFilter: true,
      // No floatingFilterComponent needed!
    },
  ];
  ```
