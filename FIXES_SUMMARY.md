# DateFilter Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ DateFilter Not Applying Filters (Original Issue)

**Problem**: DateFilter's `doesFilterPass` method wasn't parsing relative dates correctly.

**Fix**:

- Added `parseRelativeDate` import and logic to handle relative date expressions
- Fixed test parameter structure from `doesFilterPass(node)` to `doesFilterPass({ node })`
- Added helper function `parseModelDate` to handle both relative and absolute dates

**Files Modified**:

- `/src/components/DateFilter/index.tsx`
- `/src/components/DateFilter/DateFilter.integration.test.tsx`

### 2. ✅ DateFilter Not Showing Current State

**Problem**: When filters were applied programmatically (via SavedViews or QuickFilterDropdown), the DateFilter UI didn't reflect the current filter state.

**Fix**:

- Refactored AGGridDateFilter wrapper to use refs and delegation pattern
- Now properly passes through all AG Grid filter methods to the DateFilter component

**File Modified**:

- `/src/components/DateFilter/AGGridDateFilter.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Active Filter Pills Not Clickable

**Problem**: Users couldn't click on active filter pills to edit the filters.

**Fix**:

- Made ActiveFilters.Item component clickable with proper accessibility
- Added hover effects and cursor pointer styling
- Clicking opens the filter UI using AG Grid's `showColumnMenuAfterButtonClick` API

**Files Modified**:

- `/src/components/ActiveFilters/components.tsx`
- `/src/demo/styles/headless-components.css`

### 4. ✅ Infinite Loop When Selecting Date Presets

**Problem**: Selecting "Last 7 days" from presets caused an infinite loop of "Grid state saved to URL" messages.

**Fix**:

- Removed circular dependency in `onStateSave` callback
- The callback was calling `setFilterModel` which triggered another state save
- Now relies on the existing `filterChanged` event handler

**File Modified**:

- `/src/demo/components-showcase-complete.tsx`

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to Demo tab
3. Test each fix:
   - Apply date filters and verify they actually filter the grid
   - Apply filters via presets/saved views and verify the DateFilter UI shows the current state
   - Click on active filter pills and verify the filter UI opens
   - Select date presets and verify no infinite loop in console

### Automated Tests Created

- Unit test for infinite loop prevention: `/src/demo/components-showcase-complete.test.tsx`
- Playwright E2E test for infinite loop: `/tests/e2e/datefilter-infinite-loop.spec.ts`
- Comprehensive E2E test suite: `/tests/e2e/datefilter-complete.spec.ts`

## Verification

All core functionality has been restored:

1. DateFilter properly applies both absolute and relative date filters ✅
2. DateFilter shows current state when filters are applied programmatically ✅
3. Active filter pills are clickable and open the filter UI ✅
4. No infinite loops when selecting date presets ✅
